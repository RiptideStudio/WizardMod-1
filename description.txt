From the creators of Archery Overhaul comes Sorcery Overhaul for 1.4.4.9!

Huge thanks to RockmanZeta for the port and fixes!

Sorcery Overhaul focuses on improving magic items in Terraria. We've added over 100+ unique magic items including armor, weapons, materials, 
accessories, spells, scrolls, & more!

This mod currently adds in the following 100+ items:

. 32 New Staffs
. 24 New Magic Tomes
. 13 New Accessories
. 14 New Materials
. 6 New Consumables
. 4 New Armor Sets
. 6 New Prefixes/Reforges
. 10 New Spells
. 14 Recipes for existing vanilla items
. 4 Modified vanilla items
. 2 New Enemies
. 1 New NPC

Unique Features:

. Spell Power - Spell Power gives magic weapons secondary effects, and greater effect chance
. Critical Strike Mana Recovery - Upon critical hit, some mana will be restored, can be increased by accessories and armor
. Spells - New consumable items that use spell power as a damage type
. Scrolls - Incredibly powerful consumable items that be crafted or bought from the Apprentice NPC
. Healing - There are more items in the game that heal both the player (and other players!)

Stick with us as we finish up hardmode and complete the mod!

If you didn't know, I'm actually a game developer, and I make tons of art, music and more! (This is my first terraria mod, criticism is welcome!) If you want to share your work and have fun, 
or want a list of the items in this mod, join my discord below! We try to update the mod every other week. If you want to help make sprites or code for the mod, join my Discord and send me a message!
